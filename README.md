# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms problems in Python. Each implementation includes multiple approaches to solve the same problem, demonstrating different time and space complexity trade-offs.

## Project Structure

```
algo_dsa_py/
├── Array/
│   ├── 1_Duplicate.py
│   └── 2_Anagram.py
```


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanketShahane7/algo_dsa_py.git
cd algo_dsa_py
```

2. Each problem has its own Python file with multiple solution approaches. You can import and use the classes directly in your code as shown in the examples above.
